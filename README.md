# Jasynthex


### There are serious considerations for this project, as It forms part of a bigger tool.



### For now, the implementation is limited to Json Parsing. 

When the Paser has been fully developed, the next stage for this tool would be shared.

## Tools, methodology, any thing special would be highlighted in [PROGRESS.md](https://github.com/MensahPrince/Jasynthex/blob/main/PROGRESS.md) for learners.

# Kindly pay attention to the licence of this tool.
